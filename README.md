# Express/EJS Template

This template repository contains the basic setup for an Express/EJS/PostgreSQL application. It includes:

- `app.js` with the view engine configured to `ejs`, set up to listen on port 3000.
- MVC structure with a controller, router and a view for the `"/"` endpoint.
- `pool.js` to connect to the database through variables in `.env`.
- A basic stylesheet with a number of CSS variables declared, including a dynamic dark-mode.
